# Examples

This folder contains examples in how to use and interact with Auto-Drive backend. Though it's posible to interact directly with the API REST it's recommended to use `@autonomys/auto-drive` npm package.

For using any of these examples, you'd need to have launched auto-drive backend. Read more about this in the root README of this repo.
